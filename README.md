# Mastering REST APIs with FastAPI: Social Media API

## Project Overview

This is a course project where the aim is to build a robust social media API with a plethora of features. Users will be able to register, log in, create posts, leave comments, and even like existing posts. The API will incorporate various advanced features like user authentication via Bearer (JWT) tokens, email sending functionalities, and file upload capabilities.
